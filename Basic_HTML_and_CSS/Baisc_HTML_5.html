				<summary>A Scanner Darkly</summary>
				<p>A Scanner Darkly is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick,
				<br>published in 1977. The semi-autobiographical story is set in a dystopian Orange 
				<br>County, California, in the then-future of June 1994, and includes an extensive 
				<br>portrayal of drug culture and drug use (both recreational and abusive). 
				<br>The novel is one of Dick's best-known works and served as the basis for a 2006 
				<br>film of the same name, directed by Richard Linklater.
